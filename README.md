SolidJS boilerplate for building modern web applications.

## Framework

SolidJS is a declarative, efficient and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Solid is a purely reactive library. It was designed from the ground up with a reactive core. It's influenced by reactive principles developed by previous libraries. Check out more about it [there](https://www.solidjs.com/).

## Tests

Combination of Jest as a test runner and Testing Library to ensure your app is working as expected.

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used,the more confidence they can give you.

Write maintainable tests and develop with confidence. Besides, it helps you write an application that will be accessible by default.

## Enforcing code style

Use ESLint and Prettier to enforce code style across your app. Make code more readable, catch common mistakes and make development a pleasure. Moreover, Husky and lint-staged prevent commits with problems in the first place.

## CI/CD

It utilizes GitHub Actions for continuously making sure that your app is in the best possible state. Combine all of the above always when you update your repository. Moreover, automatically upload tests coverage to [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/)- a platform that lets you track testing in your app. All actions are pinned to commit SHA for increased security.
